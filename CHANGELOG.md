# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.0.35] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Distributed Architecture (WebUI Proxying)** — Integrated a thin-client architecture for the WebUI. The `shibaclaw-web` process no longer instantiates the LLM, memory, or background consumers. It delegates all processing via a new internal streaming API on the `shibaclaw-gateway`.
- **NDJSON Streaming API** — The gateway now supports streaming agent progress and tool execution status via HTTP, allowing remote UI clients to maintain real-time interactivity.
- **Heartbeat & Cron Delegation** — Automated tasks are now unified and run strictly in the gateway process, even when triggered from the WebUI.

### Fixed
- **Massive RAM usage reduction** — Eliminated duplication of the entire agent core between processes. `shibaclaw-web` memory footprint dropped by nearly 90% (no longer loads heavy ML models or provider libraries internally).
- **Service dependencies** — Added `depends_on` in `docker-compose` to ensure the gateway is available before the UI attempts to proxy requests.
- **`web --with-gateway` host routing** — Bare-metal launches now force the spawned gateway onto local loopback and export the correct internal WebUI URL, fixing `Gateway unreachable: [Errno -2] Name or service not known` when the saved config still pointed to the Docker hostname `shibaclaw-gateway` or when the WebUI used a custom port.

## [0.0.31] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **`exec` tool broken (NameError)** — Added the missing `_BoundedBuffer` class definition in `shell.py`. In v0.0.30 the class was referenced but never defined, causing every shell command to fail with `NameError: name '_BoundedBuffer' is not defined`.

## [0.0.30] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Race condition dual consumer** — Fixed a bug where WebUI in standalone mode started both inbound polling and outbound dispatcher, causing lost messages because it competed with its own outbound consumer.
- **Missing feedback on long execution** — `ExecTool` now sends a progress heartbeat every 15s to the UI during long-running commands, so it doesn't look stuck.
- **Subagent context explosion** — Subagent tool results are now properly truncated at 8,000 chars to avoid exploding the context window.
- **Hanging agent loop** — Added 120s timeout to LLM provider calls, 660s timeout to tool execution, and 600s overall wall-clock loop cap to prevent infinite hangs.
- **Telegram Conflict error loop** — Replaced silent retry loop with graceful fallback to outbound-only mode if another bot instance is polling.
- **Gateway connection check** — Added retry backoff when checking if gateway is reachable to give Docker container startup time to bind ports, preventing false negative conflicts.

## [0.0.28] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Heartbeat frontmatter config** — `HEARTBEAT.md` now supports a real YAML config block at the top for `session_key`, `profile_id`, and explicit `targets`.
- **Heartbeat target aliases** — output targets like `webui: recent` or `telegram: recent` now resolve to the most recent session for that channel.

### Changed
- **Heartbeat template semantics** — the bundled `HEARTBEAT.md` template is now the actual source of heartbeat session/profile/target settings, while `enabled` and `interval_s` remain in global settings. Upgrading users are recommended to reset their workspace `HEARTBEAT.md` once to pick up the new base frontmatter block.
- **Heartbeat status UI** now shows the effective session key, profile, and targets.

### Fixed
- **Heartbeat token waste** — the heartbeat service no longer calls the LLM when `HEARTBEAT.md` has no real active tasks in the `Active Tasks` section.
- **Cron blank jobs** — agent-turn cron jobs with an empty message are now skipped instead of invoking the agent unnecessarily.

## [0.0.26] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Profile hover highlight** — dropdown items had no visible hover state because `--bg-hover` CSS variable was undefined; replaced with the correct `--bg-surface-hover`.
- **Welcome screen logo** now updates when switching profiles, matching the sidebar logo and chat avatars.

### Changed
- Removed dead CSS rules (`.chat-header-info h2`, `.chat-header-subtitle`) targeting elements no longer in the HTML.

## [0.0.25] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Agent Profiles — Per-Session Personas**
    - Switch the agent's personality on-the-fly via a dropdown in the chat header.
    - 5 built-in profiles: **Default** (original ShibaClaw), **Builder** (code-first, minimal chatter), **Planner** (strategic thinking, breaks down problems), **Reviewer** (critical eye, finds issues), **Hacker** (elite security expert).
    - Each profile overrides the agent's SOUL.md prompt — model, provider, and memory stay shared.
    - Profile selection is **per-session**: different sessions can use different personas simultaneously.
    - Profiles are stored as simple `profiles/<id>/SOUL.md` folders in the workspace — easy to read, edit, and version.
- **Custom Profile Creation via Agent**
    - "Create custom profile" button opens a new session with a structured prompt that walks you through defining a new persona interactively.
    - The agent generates the SOUL.md, saves it, and registers it in the manifest — no manual file editing needed.
- **Dynamic Profile Avatars**
    - Profiles can have a custom avatar image (configured via `avatar` field in `manifest.json`).
    - Switching profiles updates **all visible agent avatars** in the chat and sidebar in real-time.
    - Switching back to Default restores the original ShibaClaw logo.
- **Hacker Profile — Full Security Toolkit**
    - Elite security persona with deep expertise in 7 domains: web app security, network/AD attacks, code auditing, container/cloud, cryptography, reverse engineering, and forensics.
    - Includes a curated **toolkit of 50+ security tools and packages** (Python, Node.js, CLI) with quick-install commands.
    - Follows OWASP WSTG, PTES, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CIS Benchmarks, and Kill Chain methodologies.
    - Structured vulnerability reporting with CVSS v3.1/v4.0 scores, CWE, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
    - 10-step code audit checklist from attack surface mapping to full report.
    - Custom hacker avatar (red cyber-shiba with sunglasses).
- **Profile Startup Sync**
    - Built-in profile templates are auto-synced to the workspace on startup (like skills).
    - Corrupted or missing manifests are automatically repaired.
    - New fields (e.g. `avatar`) are merged into existing profiles without overwriting user customizations.
- **Profile API** (`/api/profiles`)
    - `GET /api/profiles` — list all profiles with metadata and avatar URLs.
    - `GET /api/profiles/{id}` — get profile details including SOUL.md content.
    - `POST /api/profiles` — create a new custom profile (with optional avatar).
    - `PUT /api/profiles/{id}` — update profile metadata, soul, or avatar.
    - `DELETE /api/profiles/{id}` — delete custom profiles (built-in profiles are protected).

### Changed
- **Context system prompt** is now profile-aware: cache keys and mtime tracking are per-profile.
- **Session metadata** stores `profile_id` — survives session switches and reconnections.
- **Socket.IO events** (`connected`, `session_reset`) emit `profile_id` for frontend sync.

## [0.0.23] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **WebUI file/message attachment freeze** — `_consume_outbound` was matching sessions by socket `sid` instead of `session_key`, causing all messages dispatched via the `message()` tool to be silently dropped. The UI would hang indefinitely in loading state. Fixed session lookup, room target (`session:{key}`), and history persist logic.

## [0.0.22] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Skills Management WebUI**
    - New Settings → Skills panel: browse all installed skills (builtin + workspace), view descriptions, source badges, and missing requirements.
    - **Always Active Pinning** — pin skills to be loaded on every conversation. Configurable limit via `max_pinned_skills` (default 5).
    - **Skill Import** — upload `.zip` archives containing SKILL.md skill folders (UI uses automatic overwrite for a simpler flow).
    - **Skill Deletion** — delete workspace-scoped skills from the UI (builtin skills are protected).
    - **ClaWHub Link** — quick-access button to open https://clawhub.ai/ for community skill discovery.
- **Skills REST API** (`/api/skills`)
    - `GET /api/skills` — list all skills with metadata, availability, and pinned status.
    - `POST /api/skills/pin` — update the always-active pinned skills list.
    - `DELETE /api/skills/{name}` — remove a workspace skill.
    - `POST /api/skills/import` — multipart zip upload with conflict policy and dry-run mode.
- **Config: `pinned_skills` & `max_pinned_skills`**
    - New fields in `agents.defaults` for persistent always-active skill configuration.
    - Improved import compatibility for common zip layouts, including `SKILL.md` at archive root.

### Changed
- **Settings Redesign — Vertical Sidebar**
    - Settings modal redesigned from horizontal tabs to a vertical sidebar layout (9 sections: Agent, Provider, Tools, MCP, Gateway, Channels, Skills, OAuth, Update).
    - Last active tab is persisted in localStorage.
    - Responsive: sidebar collapses to horizontal icon strip at ≤700px viewport.
    - Modal enlarged to 880×700px to accommodate the new layout.

## [0.0.21] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **DNS Rebinding Protection**
    - New `resolve_and_pin()` function in `security/network.py` that resolves a URL, validates all IPs, and returns pinned addresses to prevent DNS rebinding attacks (TOCTOU between validation and fetch).
    - Refactored internal helpers (`_resolve_all_ips`, `_check_ips`) shared by all validation entry points.
    - `validate_resolved_url()` now fully re-resolves hostnames on redirect instead of only checking IP literals.
- **Opt-In Per-Sender Rate Limiting**
    - `MessageBus` now supports `rate_limit_per_minute` (default `0` = disabled) using a sliding-window counter per sender.
    - New `gateway.rate_limit_per_minute` config field — set to e.g. `60` to cap inbound messages per sender. Disabled by default to preserve user freedom.
    - Exceeding the limit silently drops the message with a warning log.
- **WhatsApp Bridge Security Warning**
    - Logs a warning at startup if the WhatsApp bridge URL is not on localhost, since `bridge_token` is transmitted in cleartext over the WebSocket.
- **SECURITY.md**
    - Complete security policy: supported versions, responsible disclosure process (email + GitHub Security Advisories), response timeline, security architecture overview.

### Changed
- **npm Audit Already Implemented** — Confirmed and documented that `_audit_npm` was already wired in `install_audit.py` for npm/yarn/pnpm commands, parsing the npm audit v2+ JSON format. No code change needed — this was a documentation gap.

## [0.0.20] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Update Apply Endpoint**
    - New `POST /api/update/apply` endpoint to apply updates directly from the WebUI (backup personal files + pip upgrade + automatic restart).
- **OpenAI Codex OAuth in WebUI**
    - Codex login now works from the WebUI Settings → OAuth panel via `oauth-cli-kit` device flow, replacing the previous `501 Not Implemented` stub.
- **Documentation**
    - Added `shibaclaw web` mode to the deploy guide and useful commands table.
    - Added `memory` and `cron` skills to the skills README.

### Fixed
- **Runtime crash on server restart** — Added missing `import sys` in `system.py` that caused `NameError` when calling `/api/restart` or applying updates.
- **OAuth job state lost on restart** — Moved OAuth job tracking from fragile `globals()` dict to `AgentManager.oauth_jobs` instance attribute, preventing state loss during process lifecycle.
- **Fragile YAML frontmatter parsing in skills** — `get_skill_metadata()` now uses `yaml.safe_load` (PyYAML) for robust parsing of skill frontmatter, with automatic fallback to the previous line-by-line parser if PyYAML is unavailable.

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — Added `pyyaml>=6.0` as an explicit dependency for reliable skill metadata parsing.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Agent Settings UI**
    - Model input field now has history tracking and auto-completion from previously used models.
    - Provider input field changed to a dropdown showing only configured providers (API key, local base URL, or OAuth), defaulting to "auto".
- **Audio Messaging Support (STT & TTS)**
    - Integrated multi-provider Speech-to-Text (STT) pipeline using OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., Groq/Whisper).
    - Browser-native Text-to-Speech (TTS) for agent responses with automatic markdown/code cleaning.
    - Automatic Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with silence threshold and duration settings.
- **WebUI Enhancements**
    - High-quality visual feedback for voice recording with pulse animation on the microphone button.
    - Transcription feedback: "Transcribing..." placeholder with shimmer effect during audio processing.
    - Dedicated "Voice & Audio" section in Agent Settings to configure provider URL, API key, and model.
    - TTS user preference persistence via `localStorage`.
- **Backend Improvements**
    - New `AudioConfig` schema for central management of speech settings.
    - Refactored `transcribe_audio` Socket.IO event handler for better performance and reliability.

### Changed
- **UI Refinements**
    - Improved chat input bar aesthetics: microphone and attachment (clip) buttons are now closer and visually aligned.
    - Text-to-Speech (Bot Voice) now defaults to "off" for a cleaner initial experience.

### Fixed
- **Code Hygiene**
    - Removed unused properties and redundant comments in speech and socket modules.
    - Refactored backend imports and improved error handling for transcription failures.

## [0.0.17] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **WebUI Server Module**
    - New standalone `server.py` with `create_app()` / `run_server()` for cleaner separation of server lifecycle from API routes.
    - Automatic agent initialization, skill sync, and cron startup on server boot (background tasks).
    - Update check on startup with non-blocking notification.

### Changed
- **Architecture: Frontend Modularization**
    - `app.js` (3,289 lines) split into 8 focused modules in `static/js/`: `state.js`, `auth.js`, `utils.js`, `api_socket.js`, `chat.js`, `files.js`, `ui_panels.js`, `main.js`.
    - `index.css` (3,293 lines) split into 9 thematic stylesheets in `static/css/`: `vars.css`, `sidebar.css`, `chat.css`, `responsive.css`, `panels.css`, `modals.css`, `modals_responsive.css`, `login.css`, `components.css`. Entry `index.css` now uses `@import` directives.
    - index.html updated to load the new JS modules in dependency order.
- **Architecture: Backend Modularization**
    - `api.py` (1,038 lines) refactored: route handlers extracted into `shibaclaw/webui/routers/` package with 10 focused modules (`auth.py`, `sessions.py`, `settings.py`, `fs.py`, `gateway.py`, `heartbeat.py`, `oauth.py`, `cron.py`, `system.py`, `onboard.py`).
    - Shared helpers (`_gateway_request`, `_deep_merge`, `_redact_secrets`, `_resolve_workspace_path`, context caches) moved to new `shibaclaw/webui/utils.py` to prevent circular imports.
    - `api.py` now re-exports all route handlers for backward compatibility with `server.py`.
- **Codebase Cleanup**
    - Removed redundant comments and consolidated duplicated logic across `api.py`, `socket_io.py`, `loop.py`, and `app.js`.
    - Streamlined imports across backend modules.
    - Removed stale `.bak` backup files and `__pycache__` artifacts.
    - Replaced dangerous wildcard imports (`from utils import *`) with explicit named imports.

### Fixed
- **WebUI Visibility** — Fixed an issue where the interface would fail to render correctly or appear empty after a manual page refresh by ensuring correct script loading order and state initialization in the new modular architecture.
- **WebUI Context Endpoint** — Fixed `NameError: '_build_real_system_prompt' is not defined` caused by wildcard import ignoring underscore-prefixed private functions after the backend modularization.
- **Gateway Request** — Fixed truncated `_gateway_request()` function body in `utils.py` that was partially lost during extraction from `api.py`.
- **Config & Authentication** — Enhanced config loading, authentication handling, and socket.io integration in the standalone WebUI server module.

## [0.0.16] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **WebUI & API**
    - All `/api/file-get` APIs are now public and no longer require the authentication token in the query string. Attachment handling in WebUI and Socket.IO updated to remove the token from URLs.
    - Improved message ID handling in WebUI responses: `message_id` is now propagated if present in metadata.
    - Thread-safe settings synchronization in WebUI (`api_settings_post` now uses an asyncio lock).
    - Refactored restart functions (`_safe_argv`) to accept only flags and known subcommands, both in agent loop and WebUI.

### Fixed
- **Authentication**
    - Hardened: token comparison now only on Authorization header, no longer on query parameters.
    - `/api/file-get` added to `PUBLIC_PATHS` to avoid authentication errors on attachment downloads.
- **WebUI**
    - Fixed MCP settings display and save: the field is always `mcpServers` (camelCase) and a note is shown if only the example server is present.
    - Fixed attachment handling in WebUI and Socket.IO responses (token removed from URLs).
- **Config**
    - Automatic migration: MCP servers are now populated with all default fields if missing, and an example is added if the section is empty.
    - Onboarding plugins/channels is executed both on new creation and on loading existing config.
- **Agent loop**
    - Fixed regex for multiline media parsing in responses.
    - Corrected the position of the `MessageTool._sent_in_turn` check to avoid duplicate responses.

### Added
- **WebUI**
    - Asyncio lock for settings update.
    - Shared `_safe_argv` function between agent loop and WebUI for safe restart.
    - UI note for example MCP server.
    - Propagation of `message_id` in agent → WebUI responses.

## [0.0.15] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **MCP Settings UI** — Added an MCP tab to the WebUI settings with support for configuring `tools.mcp_servers`, including stdio and HTTP/SSE server definitions.

### Fixed
- **Context window overrun** — Fixed token estimation undercounting that caused sessions to exceed the context window. `estimate_prompt_tokens()` now includes message roles, tool calls, and structural overhead (+4 tokens per message).
- **Compaction triggering too late** — Lowered the consolidation trigger threshold from 100% to 60% of context window, with a target of 40%, providing a safe margin before hitting the limit.
- **Telegram proxy saved as `{}` instead of `null`** — Fixed `_deep_merge` in WebUI API to correctly handle `None` values and empty dicts, preventing config corruption when the proxy field is cleared from Settings (#11).
- **WebUI gateway health check fallback** — Fixed intermittent `Gateway Down` status in Docker by centralizing gateway host resolution and ensuring the WebUI tries both local host and the Docker gateway hostname when the gateway is configured as `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`.
- **Heartbeat unreachable in standalone WebUI** — Fixed `heartbeat_status: gateway request failed` when running `shibaclaw web` without a separate gateway process. The WebUI now initializes its own `HeartbeatService` and falls back to it when the gateway is not available.
- **"Gateway Down" in standalone mode** — Fixed the WebUI health check reporting the gateway as down when running in bare-metal standalone mode. The health check now falls back to the local agent's status if no external gateway is found.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Gateway health check in bare metal setups** — Fixed false "Gateway Down" status in WebUI when running `pip install` setups. The health check now correctly uses the configured `gateway.host` value (e.g. `127.0.0.1`) instead of defaulting to the Docker-only `shibaclaw-gateway` hostname.
- Affected functions: `api_gateway_health`, `_gateway_request`, `api_gateway_restart` in `api.py`, and `_poll_github_token` in `oauth_github.py`.

## [0.0.13] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Email channel UI** — Reorganized email settings in WebUI into three sections: 📥 Email IN (IMAP), 📤 Email OUT (SMTP), ⚙️ General, with human-readable labels and proper input types.
- **Config auto-migration** — Email channel fields are now automatically populated with defaults on server startup if missing, without overwriting existing values.

### Fixed
- **Security: Socket.IO authentication bypass** — Removed `/socket.io` from public paths so WebSocket connections now require a valid auth token.
- **Security: Auth token leakage in URLs** — Removed the auth token from upload response URLs to prevent credential exposure in server logs and browser history.
- **Security: SSRF in update manifest validation** — Replaced naive `startswith()` checks with proper `urlparse()` validation and an explicit hostname allowlist (`github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`).
- **Security: Timing attack on token comparison** — Switched to `hmac.compare_digest()` for constant-time auth token verification.
- **Stability: Race condition in task callback cleanup** — Added safe task removal with `ValueError` handling to prevent crashes during concurrent `/stop` commands.
- **Correctness: Severity comparison logic** — Rewrote `Severity.__ge__()` and `__gt__()` to use an explicit score mapping, eliminating incorrect comparison results.

### Changed
- **Auth middleware** — Added `hmac` import and hardened `check_token()` with constant-time comparison for both header and query-param tokens.

## [0.0.12] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Guided onboarding in both CLI and WebUI, with provider detection from environment variables, OAuth handoff, model selection, template refresh, and optional channel setup.
- A new automation panel in the WebUI sidebar showing cron jobs and heartbeat status, including manual trigger actions.
- Ranked `memory_search` over `memory/HISTORY.md`, combining recency, importance, and keyword relevance.
- Heartbeat status and manual trigger endpoints exposed through the gateway and proxied in the WebUI.
- Expanded regression coverage for heartbeat telemetry, WebUI background delivery, overdue cron jobs, and memory search/template behavior.

### Changed
- Long-term memory is now split between `USER.md` for durable personal profile data and `memory/MEMORY.md` for operational project context.
- `memory/MEMORY.md` now follows a priority-based structure: `Environment`, `Entities`, `Project State`, and `Dynamic Context`.
- `shibaclaw onboard` is now the primary setup command; the old `--wizard` flow has been removed in favor of the new guided experience.
- The WebUI now includes onboarding entry points from startup, settings, and the empty-state experience, plus a refreshed footer layout.
- Release metadata now includes a dedicated `CHANGELOG.md`, a richer 0.0.12 update manifest, and automatic manifest upload in the release workflow.

### Fixed
- Scheduled jobs created from WebUI or channels now keep a stable session target for delivery, including WebUI sessions and threaded channel flows.
- One-shot `at` cron jobs that become overdue while the service is down now execute on startup instead of remaining stuck forever.
- Cron execution no longer races between Docker containers: the WebUI process is now the single cron runner and initializes eagerly on startup.
- Heartbeat delivery now chooses a stable target session, can notify WebUI sessions directly, and exposes live telemetry for troubleshooting.
- Update manifest path handling is normalized so the update panel can correctly identify changed personal files in this and older manifest formats.

### Upgrade Notes
- Run `shibaclaw onboard` after upgrading if you want to refresh workspace templates and built-in skills for the new onboarding and memory layout.
- Existing `USER.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`, `memory/HISTORY.md`, and workspace skill files are preserved unless you explicitly overwrite them.
- Restart the WebUI or Docker stack after upgrading so cron and heartbeat services pick up the new session-aware routing logic.
